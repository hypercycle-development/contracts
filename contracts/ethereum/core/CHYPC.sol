/** 
@title  HyperCycle Containerized HyPC ERC721 contract.
@author Barry Rowe, David Liendo
@notice This is the containerized version of the HyPC ERC20 token. Any holder of HyPC
        can swap 2^19 (ie: 524288) HyPC for 1 c_HyPC token, and redeem 1 c_HyPC for 524288
        HyPC. c_HyPC can be assigned to a license (done via a string assignement), which
        is provides proof that this license is backed by a sufficient amount of HyPC.
@dev    The numbering system for the c_HyPC tokenIds comes from the Earth64 global tree,
        starting at the far left 27th level in the binary tree with, corresponding to
        2^26 (67108864) as the node number, with each sequential number corresponding to
        the next node to the right on that 27th level, with a maximum number of nodes
        being 4096. Note that 4096*524288 = 2^31 is the total supply of HyPC tokens.
